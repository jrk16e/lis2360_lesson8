            <p>When applying for jobs always to your best to be extremely professional and prompt. After you had already applied somewhere to work at you usually will wait a few weeks to hear back about your application. Once hearing back you must prepare for your interview! Its important to be prepared before going to the interview so you're comfortable and able to be your best self. Sources say some of the most important things employers look for in a job interview are people who demonstrate eye contact, on time and prepared.  </p>&nbsp;
            
            <p>When it comes to being prepared there are a few things to do. Before going to the interivew study some information on the company so you're well informed of who you're working for. It is also important to identify something about you which you really want them to hire you. Not just something basic like a hardworker but something like a passionate employee who strives to work harder. Its important to relax and be positive about the outcome because there is no way to know what questions you'll be asked. One example of an off guard question is to explain your biggest weakness. However with practice before the interview you can stay calm and briefly think before answering. It is also important to dress in appropriate attire. For example never wear jeans and a tshirt to a job interview, dress up and look presentable.</p>&nbsp;

            <p>In the images above there are two different job interviews taking place. In the one with two people we see the professional handshake, eye contact and firendliness with the smile the woman is giving. In the other interview the woman is being interviewed by multiple people across a table. This situation may seem intimidating but staying calm and focused is important. We can see this woman is focused and has good posture showing her care for what she is saying.<br></p>
            
            <p>In the last image we see two men standing next to eachother. This is an example of interview attire you should wear versus what you should'nt wear. Jeans, a tshirt and tennis shoes are not appropraite. You must demonstarte to the complany that you care and are able to be presentable for an important occasion such as getting a job. On the left side we see a man in a suit and tie with dress shoes. This shows that the interivew is important to him and he would be hired over the man coming in wearing jeans.</q></p>&nbsp;
